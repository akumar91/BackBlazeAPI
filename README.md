# BackBlazeAPI

Create a small application using data stored in B2:


Setup:
* Create a B2 account on the Backblaze website (www.backblaze.com)
Note: you do not need to put down a credit card to create a B2 account
* Sign in to your B2 account
* Create a B2 Bucket on the Buckets page
* Add some files to your bucket

Create a runnable Java application that will list the files in your bucket and download them to a designated directory.
You can use the Java samples provided in the B2 API documentation: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/
